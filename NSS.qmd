## Introduction
### Unpacking NSS and Graduate Outcomes (GO) Metrics

- Why bother perforning well in domestic league tables (DLT)?
- Overview of the National Student Survey
- Importance of NSS for UK universities
- What aew GO and how it fits in?

---

## Financial Challenges & Current Environment.

- Freeze on home student fee means decreasing return with inflation but costs rising…
- Home fee for equity with original set value should be £14,000
- Maintaining good retention and progression is a challenge with current losses in the 8-10% range (BP update at end of moneh) compared with historical 5%.

---

## How we react.

- Along with strategies to improve retentions...we take more students to offset.
- But we aren't the only ones that are in this position..so..

# Competitive Market
This presents a yearly risk as we are a 'clearing' University with 1000+ places per year needed.
:::

- Concern is that student rely on 'Good University...' table and guides that influence their choice
- NSS and Graduate Outcomes are two key measures that feed into those tables.

## Graduate Outcomes (GO)

Essentially how successful our student are at gaining graduate level employment post-graduation.


Commencing with the 2017/18 graduate cohort, the Graduate Outcomes survey has replaced the Destinations of Leavers from Higher Education (DLHE) survey. 

- Graduate Outcomes collects information about the activities and perspectives of graduates approximately 15 months after they complete their HE studies.
- "Graduate Level" jobs classified on the basis of whether they “normally require knowledge and skills developed on a three-year university degree to enable them to perform the associated tasks competently”

---

## Graduate Outcomes (GO)

- If you are still in HE at time of survey you don't get classed as not being in graduate employment but undertaking further study.

- As a Faculty we are fortunate that the commissioned professional programmes exit straight into employment.
- For traditional programmes it can be tricky as 15 months is a poor census point for some. 
  - For Psych - competitive general market and after PG study, only 3 months to secure a job. Especially an issue considering those interested in clinical.
  
- But if they do eventually get that graduate job that would be great, except 15 months is snapshot point for league tables...

## Been a downhill trend...

![Histrical GO Scores](GO_HISTORY.png)

As a Faculty we are developing years in industry that will aim to increase employment at a graduate level within 15 months for those subjects that don't have jobs automatically.

## It all comes together...

These two metrics as well as other 'Valude added' contribute to overall tables.
